# Block-Game

This is a clone of a board game with a similar name.

## Run Block-Game in Dev Mode

_Prerequisites: NodeJS_

Before running the app, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Dev mode spins up the app and opens cypress in watch mode.

```bash
npm run dev
```

To start the app in watch mode without cypress, use `npm run watch` instead of `npm run dev`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Static site output will be in `dist/` directory.
